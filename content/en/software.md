# Software

An overview of the Python and C++ projects I’ve developed over the past few years. Many of these tools were instrumental in producing results featured in my publications. Each project includes a link to its repository. For a detailed code description, please visit the respective repository.

{{< software
"emRKC"
"https://github.com/grosilho/emRKC"
"A Python implementation of the exponential multirate Runge-Kutta-Chebychev (emRKC) method with applications to the monodomain model in cardiac electrophysiology. "

{{< software
"mRKC"
"https://github.com/grosilho/mRKC"        
"C++ code for the multirate Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev method. It contains also standard (non-multirate) explicit stabilized methods (RKC, RKL, RKU) and other classical methods (EE, IE, RK4,...) for comparison."

{{< software
"BEMI"
"https://github.com/grosilho/BEMI"
"A C++ code implementing the boundary element method (BEM) method for solving the extracellular-membrane-intracellular (EMI) model."
>}}

{{< software
"SK-τ-ROCK"
"https://github.com/grosilho/sk-tau-rock_methods"        
"A C++ implementation of SK-τ-ROCK methods for stochastic chemical kinetics."
>}}

{{< software
"ROCKopt"
"https://github.com/grosilho/ROCKOpt"
"A playground to explore RKC methods for solving optimization problems, including ML."
>}}

{{< software
"Numerical integration of dynamical systems project"
"https://github.com/grosilho/ODE_Project_ImplementationRungeKutta"
"This repository contains a project related to implementing Runge-Kutta methods. The project is designed for students who are learning about numerical methods and want to gain hands-on experience with Runge-Kutta methods."
>}}

{{< software
"C++ Playground"
"https://github.com/grosilho/CPP_Playground"
"A small C++ linear algebra library with two backends, based on expression templates or the ranges library. The goal is to use different modern C++ features, as ranges, concepts, variadic templates, modules, etc."
